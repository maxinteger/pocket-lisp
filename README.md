# Pocket lisp

Pocket lisp is a Closure like programming language.

## Why

We needed a very simple and configurable domain specific language to add a little logic to mathematics exercises on our learning platform Zsebtan√°r (~pocket teacher)

## Goals

- simple
- expressive
- "fast"
- sandboxed - no access to the native runtime environment (ex. Browser, NodeJS, etc.) API
